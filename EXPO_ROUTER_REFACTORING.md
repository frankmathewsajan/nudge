# 🎉 Expo Router Refactoring Complete!

## 📁 New Architecture

```
app/
  _layout.tsx           // 🛡️ Flow Guard - redirects based on user state
  (auth)/
    _layout.tsx         // Auth group layout
    login.tsx           // Login screen
  (onboarding)/
    _layout.tsx         // Onboarding group layout  
    form.tsx            // Onboarding form
    goals.tsx           // Goals collection
  (main)/
    _layout.tsx         // Main app tabs layout
    index.tsx           // Home screen
    settings.tsx        // Settings screen
  (tabs-old)/           // 🗂️ Old structure (backup)
```

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### ✅ **No More State Spaghetti**
- Removed multiple `useState` booleans (`showOnboarding`, `showGoalCollection`, etc.)
- No more complex state synchronization logic
- Expo Router handles flow naturally

### ✅ **Flow Guard Pattern**
- Root `_layout.tsx` acts as central flow controller
- Redirects users to appropriate routes based on auth/progress state
- One place to control entire app flow

### ✅ **Clean Separation**
- Auth screens in `(auth)` group
- Onboarding flow in `(onboarding)` group  
- Main app in `(main)` group with tabs
- Each group has its own layout and navigation

### ✅ **Simplified Components**
- Individual screens are now pure and focused
- No complex flow logic in components
- Easy to reason about and test

## 🔄 Flow Logic

1. **Root Layout Checks State**
   - User not authenticated? → `/(auth)/login`
   - Onboarding incomplete? → `/(onboarding)/form`
   - Goals incomplete? → `/(onboarding)/goals`  
   - Everything complete? → `/(main)`

2. **Natural Progression**
   - Login → redirects based on progress
   - Onboarding form → goals
   - Goals → main app
   - Settings accessible from main app

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Expo Router handles flow** instead of manual state juggling
- **URL-based navigation** - users can deep link to specific flows
- **Better developer experience** - easier to understand and debug
- **Scalable** - adding new screens/flows is straightforward
- **Type-safe routing** (once Expo Router generates types)

## 🛠️ Services Used

- `userProgressService` - centralized persistence logic
- `authService` - authentication management
- `useUserData` - simplified hook for user data (replaces complex useAppFlow)

The app now follows the **"Let the Router Handle Flow"** pattern instead of manual boolean state management! 🎊
