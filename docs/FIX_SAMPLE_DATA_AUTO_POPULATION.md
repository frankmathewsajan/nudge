# Fixed: Sample Data Auto-Population After Clearing

## Problem
After clearing all data in Settings, the app was immediately re-populating with sample activity data, preventing the onboarding flow from working properly.

## Root Cause
Sample data initialization was happening automatically in two places:
1. **Global App Startup** (`app/_layout.tsx`) - Called `initializeSampleData()` on every app launch
2. **Track Tab Load** (`app/(tabs)/track.tsx`) - Called `initializeSampleData()` when loading activity data

This created a race condition where:
1. User clears data in Settings → navigates to Home
2. App restarts and immediately calls `initializeSampleData()` 
3. Sample data is added before onboarding can complete
4. User sees "activity already exists" instead of onboarding

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Removed Automatic Sample Data Initialization

#### 1. App Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  setupNotificationCategories();
  initializeSleepState();
  initializeSampleData(); // ❌ Auto-populated data on every startup
}, []);
```

**After:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  setupNotificationCategories();
  initializeSleepState();
  // ✅ Removed automatic sample data population
}, []);
```

#### 2. Track Tab (`app/(tabs)/track.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
const loadActivityData = async () => {
  try {
    await initializeSampleData(); // ❌ Auto-populated data on tab load
    const data = await getAllActivityData();
    setDayActivityData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading activity data:', error);
  }
};
```

**After:**
```tsx
const loadActivityData = async () => {
  try {
    // ✅ Only loads existing data, no automatic population
    const data = await getAllActivityData();
    setDayActivityData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading activity data:', error);
  }
};
```

### ✅ Cleaned Up Unused Imports
- Removed `initializeSampleData` import from both files
- Kept the function available for manual initialization if needed

## Result

Now when users clear all data:
1. ✅ Data is actually cleared and stays cleared
2. ✅ Onboarding flow appears as expected
3. ✅ No race condition between clearing and re-populating
4. ✅ Users can start fresh with their own goals and activities

## Sample Data Still Available
The `initializeSampleData()` function still exists and can be called manually for:
- Development testing
- Demo purposes
- First-time app setup (if explicitly needed)

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Go to Settings → Clear All Data
2. App should navigate to Home and show onboarding
3. No activity logs should appear in console
4. User can complete onboarding and set their own goals
